Recipe Make project 

I have made a software application which allows a user to enter details for a recipe then display the recipe while allowing for the user to have options like to scale the recipe or to revert the changes, to clear the recipe and to enter a new recipe. I used Visual Studios 2022 and a .NET framework project to create the command line application. The programming language used is C# (Hillary Nyakundi,2021). 

To use project, download the project from GitHub or from VC learn submission. Unzip the file and run it on Visual Studios 2022 (Hillary Nyakundi,2021). 

To install the project: 

1. Go to the GitHub Link: https://github.com/Mohammad-Sharif/PROG6221.POEPART1.ST10045844.git  

2. Download the project. 

2. The project requires the program Visual Studios Community 2022 and run it.
